This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## Quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- debug uncertainty plotting after recent changes
- reconcile intervention uncertainty with outputs structures for scenario and epi uncertainty
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty I think)
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
