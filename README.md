This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## Quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty I think)
- tidy up MDR introduction time code and reconcile with population adjustment

- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
