This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- work through inputs - up to about line 250 of inputs.py
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty)
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook

## Major outstanding tasks
- low quality health sector
- HIV
- optimisation
- outputs link to GUI
- full code review

## current questions for Bosco:
- can we get the age sliders set up too
- should we move all the parameterisation to the GUI - if so, with sliders or some other form of input
- related to last question, how can we best incorporate some more numerical inputs
- can we have different default running settings for different countries
