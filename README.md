This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty)
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook

## Current questions for Bosco
- can we get the age sliders set up too
- is the project structure correct - I thought the root files should also be included
- why can't I load the dependencies for Python 3.6
