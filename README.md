## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty)
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
- revise the general approach to treatment success rates / death proportion so that the sum of these two could never get over 1.0
