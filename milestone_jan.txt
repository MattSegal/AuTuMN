For this model, we focus on a model with pulmonary status, and complex disease state and treatment.

# output (2014)

philippines incidence 2014 = 288 (254–324)
philippines prevalence 2014 = 417 (367–471)
philippines mortality 2014 = 10 (9.1–11)

incidence is the sum of all the flows from any latent compartment to any active compartment - divided
by the total population size, divided by 100,000

prevalence is the sum of the size of all the compartments other than susceptible and latent (i.e.
active, detected, faildetect, treated) - divided by 100,000

mortality is the sum of all the flows to tb_death - divided by the total population size, divided
by 100,000

total population = 99,000,000 in 2014

equilibrium 1% fractional change, for all active compartments over 5 years
