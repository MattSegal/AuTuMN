This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
- the model would not run without age-stratification (detected when running Bulgaria)

## major outstanding tasks
- outputs link to GUI
- low quality health sector
- HIV
- optimisation
- full code review

## medium-term elaborations hoping to add too
- uncertainty for economics (an extension to intervention uncertainty)

## current questions for Bosco:
- can we get the age sliders set up too
- can we have different default running settings for different countries
- run from server
- display graphs
