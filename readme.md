This is a set of Python models that modularises the development of dynamic transmission models and allows a
pluggable API to other system. Applied to tuberculosis.

## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
- the model would not run without age-stratification (detected when running Bulgaria)

## major outstanding tasks
- Bulgaria paper
- Bhutan inputs
- age-specific parameterisation
- mapping to DALYs, QALYs
- optimisation

## minor tasks
- simplify code for automatic detection of int_uncertainty start_time. Should use common method with optimisation start_dates
