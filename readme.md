## quick run

```> python gui.py```

## TODO
- setup.py file to load all dependent modules
- document Bulgaria interventions properly in handbook
- the model would not run without age-stratification (detected when running Bulgaria)

## major outstanding tasks
- Bulgaria paper
- low quality health sector
- optimisation
- age-specific parameterisation
- HIV - possibly
